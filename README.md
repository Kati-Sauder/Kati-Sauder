## Hi there 👋

I'm Kati – Cloud Enthusiast

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I’m currently learning for my AWS Cloud Practitioner Exam and when there's time left I'm building small, practical cloud and security projects to deepen my understanding of modern infrastructure, automation, and secure design principles.

## 📂 Featured Projects


### 🌐 AWS GroceryMate App - Project from Masterschool's Cloud track
> The repository focuses on the infrastructure aspects of the GroceryMate application — including modular components such as ALB, ASG, Lambda, RDS, and more.

### 🚫 AWS Smart S3 Upload Scanner with Alerting
> This project automatically checks images that are uploaded to an S3 bucket. The content is analyzed with the help of Amazon Rekognition. It labels the images (car, person, cat, etc.) and if inappropriate content (violence, drugs, nudity, etc.) is detected, an e-mail notification is sent via SNS.

## 📌 Current Goals

- ☁️ AWS Cloud Practitioner certification (by end of July 2025)
- 🔐 Learn more about security tools like IAM audit, bucket hardening, logging
- 💡 Deepen my AWS knowledge by building small projects (next up: SNS, SQS, EventBridge, Lambda)
- ⚙️ Improve infrastructure-as-code with Terraform

## ⚡ Fun Fact

> I believe the best way to learn is by just doing it. Just dive in, try out and fail. A lot. Then learn from it and try to improve. Currently I am **building small, focused projects** – and documenting everything along the way. And I learn a lot :)
